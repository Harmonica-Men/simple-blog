  The database design for this project includes Four tables. The first table is a review table. This table houses all the data associated with making a review on the site. There is a customer table, which houses the details of the customer and this is linked to a booking table via a foreign key relationship. The booking table contains the information needed in order for users to make a booking. The last table present is the user table. This table has the information necessary for users to have an account on the website and has a foreign key relationship with the customer table.

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment
This site was deployed to and is currently [hosted on the Heroku platform](https://mysimpleblog-1c6e9d449421.herokuapp.com/). The steps for deploying to Heroku, using PostgreSQL as the database host, are as follows:

#### Create a new PostgreSQL Code Institute database.

From codeinstitute every student can maintain up to eight databases to run there projects. Here is a step by step guide to install PostgreSQL from Code Institute to the cloud!

  1. Navigate to [PostgreSQL from Code Institute](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net//) and input with your LMS account
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step1](static/images/readme-images/001.png)

  2. After you filled in your LMS account the PostgresSQL database manager will automatically generate a new database for you.
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step2](static/images/readme-images/002.png)

  3. You now have a brand new PostgreSQL Code Institute database
  The link to this database and how to manage all your other databases will be sent to my email. 
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step3](static/images/readme-images/003.png)
  4. **Note:** These databases are limited in time and have a life time of operation of 18 months after the date of creation.
  ![PostgreSQL database creation step4](static/images/readme-images/004.png)
  5. infoknop
  6. copy/paste url-link
  7. paste this in  your env.py & heroku varibles.
 
#### Deploy the project 
  In the previous topic, I have created a PostgreSQL database. In this topic, you are challenged to deploy your project to Heroku.
  First you go to the Heroku website and login whit your credentials. 

  0. Set up your Heroku account 
  ...



  
  Part 1 - Create the Heroku app:
  1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name in a GDPR region Europe 
  Note: No Django static file collection will be required during the build.
  2. In your new app’s settings tab, ensure the **Config Vars** click on **Reveal Config Vars** button to define new variables in the inputs fields: 
    
    "DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>"

    "SECRET_KEY", "<secret-key>"

    "CLOUDINARY_URL", "<cloudinary-URL>"


  Part 2 - Update your code for deployment:

  1. Use **pip3** to install ```gunicorn~=20.1``` and **freeze** it to the **requirements.txt** file.
  The commands at the terminal are:

    pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1 
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

  2. In the **Procfile**, add a command using **gunicorn** and **myblog wsgi** file to start the webserver.

  3. In the **myblog/settings.py** file, set the **DEBUG** constant to False and append the **'.herokuapp.com'** hostname to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** list. 
  
    web: gunicorn myblog.wsgi

  **Note:** There is a space after the colon.
  **Note:** The Procfile has no file extension.

  **Top tip!** It's a good habit to always set **DEBUG** to **False** before any deployment. Once you have completed deployment, you can set it back to True locally to continue development.
  **Double check**
    Have you changed DEBUG to False and added , **'.herokuapp.com'** to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS**?
      
      DEBUG = False
      ,'.herokuapp.com'
    
  4. Git add, commit and push the code to your GitHub repo.

    git add .
    git commit -m "readies code for deploy"
    git push origin main


Part 3 - Deploy to Heroku:

  1. In your new app’s **Deploy** tab, search for your GitHub repo and connect it to the Heroku app. Manually deploy the **main** branch of this GitHub repo is also the prefered method.
  **Note:** Start typing your project repo name into the search box and click on the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.
  After manually deploying the main branch, you can view the build output in the application’s **Activity** tab in the dashboard.

  In your new app’s resources tab, ensure you are using an eco dyno and delete any Postgres database Add-on.

  2. Click **Open app** buttin to see your deployed app. 
  If everythings goes well you on the frontpage of myblog.

  **Note:** The build must be complete before you can open the app.

import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>")
os.environ.setdefault(
    "SECRET_KEY", "(j(j_+@%s$a955-5gw=m@b-%#$slmv$0aixrck&odnq*h+ig@0")
os.environ.setdefault(
    "CLOUDINARY_URL", "<cloudinary-URL>")
